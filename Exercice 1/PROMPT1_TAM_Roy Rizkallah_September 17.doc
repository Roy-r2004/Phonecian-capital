 
(TAM) Estimation Prompt


Opening Overview (Required)
Start with a concise 2-3 paragraph summary that:
• Market Size: State overall market size in USD with confidence intervals
• TAM Methods: Outline the 2-3 methodologies you'll employ and why each is appropriate
• Core Objective: Clearly state the goal - determining plausible market capture potential
• Business Context: Anchor in company's industry, customer segments, and business model

Methodology Framework

Method 1: Bottom-Up Analysis
Why This Method: Appropriate for companies with clear customer segments and pricing models
Uncertainties: Customer count accuracy, pricing sustainability, penetration assumptions

Required Analysis:
• Identify distinct customer segments (enterprise, SMB, consumer, geographic)
• Estimate average customer value (ACV) or lifetime value (LTV) per segment
• Calculate total addressable customers in each segment
• Apply penetration rate assumptions based on company's current position
• TAM Estimate: State USD figure and label as "Bottom-Up Method"
• Calculation Steps: Show step-by-step math with key metrics
• Sources: Reference specific filings, industry reports, independent research
• Assumptions: Document all key assumptions with rationale
• Sensitivity: Test ±20% changes in customer count and pricing

Method 2: Top-Down Analysis
Why This Method: Appropriate for validating market size against industry benchmarks
Uncertainties: Market definition, filtering criteria, addressable portion accuracy

Required Analysis:
• Start with total market size from authoritative sources (Gartner, IDC, McKinsey)
• Apply relevant filters (geographic, demographic, technological, regulatory)
• Calculate addressable portion based on company's product-market fit
• Consider market maturity and saturation factors
• TAM Estimate: State USD figure and label as "Top-Down Method"
• Calculation Steps: Show filtering rationale and addressable % calculations
• Sources: Industry reports, government statistics, trade association data
• Assumptions: Document filtering criteria and market definition
• Sensitivity: Test different market size estimates and filtering criteria

Method 3: Hybrid Analysis 
Why This Method: Combines customer insights with market validation for convergence
Uncertainties: Reconciliation methodology, growth rate assumptions

Required Analysis:
• Cross-reference bottom-up customer data with top-down market trends
• Identify convergence points and discrepancies between approaches
• Apply market growth rates and competitive dynamics
• TAM Estimate: State USD figure and label as "Hybrid Method"
• Calculation Steps: Show reconciliation methodology
• Sources: Combined primary and secondary research
• Assumptions: Document growth rates and competitive scenarios
• Sensitivity: Test market growth rate variations

Market Capture Analysis

Revenue Translation (3 Scenarios)
• Conservative: 0.5-2% market share capture
• Base Case: 2-5% market share capture
• Optimistic: 5-10% market share capture

Convert market share to revenue using TAM estimates. Provide 3-year and 5-year revenue projections.

Constraints and Enablers
Constraints: Capital requirements, regulatory barriers, competitive moats, technology limitations
Enablers: Network effects, switching costs, brand recognition, distribution partnerships
