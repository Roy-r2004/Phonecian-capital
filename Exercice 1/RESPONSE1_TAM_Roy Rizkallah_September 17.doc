### **Methodology Framework**

#### **Method 1: Bottom-Up Analysis**
##### **Why This Method**
This method is particularly suitable for the company because it has a clear understanding of its customer segments and pricing models. By breaking down the market into distinct customer groups and estimating revenue per customer, we can build a detailed view of the addressable market.

##### **Uncertainties**
- **Customer Count Accuracy**: Estimating the exact number of SMBs globally or in specific regions can be challenging.
- **Pricing Sustainability**: Fluctuations in subscription pricing or competitive pressures may impact revenue projections.
- **Penetration Assumptions**: The assumed penetration rate may not fully reflect the company's market position or growth potential.

##### **Required Analysis**
1. **Identify Customer Segments**:
   - **Small Businesses**: 1-49 employees
   - **Mid-Sized Enterprises**: 50-999 employees
   - **Geographic Segments**: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East & Africa

2. **Estimate Average Customer Value (ACV) or Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
   - **Small Businesses**: Average subscription price of $XX/month, LTV of $XX.
   - **Mid-Sized Enterprises**: Average subscription price of $XX/month, LTV of $XX.

3. **Calculate Total Addressable Customers**:
   - **Small Businesses**: Estimated 10 million globally.
   - **Mid-Sized Enterprises**: Estimated 2 million globally.

4. **Apply Penetration Rate Assumptions**:
   - **Small Businesses**: 5% penetration rate (early adopters and digitally mature SMBs).
   - **Mid-Sized Enterprises**: 10% penetration rate (higher adoption due to greater complexity).

5. **TAM Estimate**:
   - **Small Businesses**: 10 million × $XX LTV × 5% = $XX billion.
   - **Mid-Sized Enterprises**: 2 million × $XX LTV × 10% = $XX billion.
   - **Total TAM (Bottom-Up Method)**: $XX billion.

##### **Calculation Steps**:
- **Step 1**: Identify customer segments and estimate customer counts.
- **Step 2**: Determine ACV or LTV per segment.
- **Step 3**: Apply penetration rates to calculate addressable customers.
- **Step 4**: Multiply addressable customers by LTV to derive TAM.

##### **Sources**:
- Company filings and internal reports.
- Industry reports from Gartner and IDC on SMB market size and adoption trends.
- Independent research on subscription pricing and customer lifetime value.

##### **Assumptions**:
- **Customer Count**: Based on global SMB data from the World Bank and industry reports.
- **Pricing**: Reflects current subscription plans and competitive benchmarking.
- **Penetration Rate**: Assumed based on company's current market share and growth projections.

##### **Sensitivity Analysis**:
- **±20% Change in Customer Count**: Recalculate TAM with ±20% variation in customer estimates.
- **±20% Change in Pricing**: Adjust subscription pricing and recalculate LTV.
