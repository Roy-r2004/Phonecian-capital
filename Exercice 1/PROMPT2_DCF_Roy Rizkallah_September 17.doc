Valuation Analysis Framework (10-Year DCF)

Model Construction Requirements
Build a conservative 10-year DCF with explicit terminal value calculation. Document all major inputs with clear rationale and source attribution.

Key Input Documentation:
• Customer Growth: Historical acquisition rates, churn analysis, market penetration assumptions
• Lifetime Value (LTV): Customer segmentation, pricing models, retention curves, upsell/cross-sell assumptions  
• Margin Evolution: Historical margin trends, operational leverage, scale economics, competitive dynamics
• Capital Requirements: Working capital needs, CapEx requirements, financing assumptions

Show how these drivers flow through to the three statements and free cash flow.

Required Output Tables

1. DCF Summary Table (5 historical + 10 projected years):
Year | Revenue | FCF | Discounted FCF | Terminal Value | Equity Value | Per-Share Value
[Years] | [USD] | [USD] | [USD] | [USD] | [USD] | [USD]

2. WACC Calculation Table:
Component | Cost | Weight | Weighted Cost | Justification
Cost of Equity | X% | Y% | Z% | [Methodology & Assumptions]
Cost of Debt | X% | Y% | Z% | [Credit Rating & Market Rates]
WACC | X% | 100% | X% | [Blended Cost of Capital]

3. FX Devaluation Premium (if applicable):
• Document any currency risk adjustments for emerging market companies
• Explain methodology and provide sensitivity analysis

Historical Benchmarking
Growth Rate Analysis:
• Compare projected 10-year CAGRs with historical 5-year averages
• Benchmark terminal growth assumptions against industry precedents
• Identify where assumptions exceed historical ranges with clear justification
• Flag any assumptions that appear aggressive relative to industry norms

Scenario Analysis

1. Bull/Base/Bear Cases (using same WACC and terminal growth):
• Bull Case: Optimistic assumptions for key growth drivers
• Base Case: Conservative, realistic assumptions
• Bear Case: Pessimistic scenario with downside risks
• Present valuation ranges for each scenario

2. Sensitivity Analysis:
• Key Metric CAGRs: ±20% changes in revenue, margin, and customer growth assumptions
• WACC/Terminal Growth: ±100bps changes in WACC and ±50bps in terminal growth
• Create sensitivity tables showing impact on equity value per share

Three-Statement Model Requirements (200-300 words)

Income Statement Projections (10 years)
Key Line Items:
• Revenue by segment/product line with growth drivers
• Cost of Goods Sold with margin evolution
• Operating expenses (SG&A, R&D) with leverage assumptions
• Interest expense and other income/expense
• Tax rate with jurisdictional considerations
• Net income and EPS calculations

Balance Sheet Projections (10 years)
Key Line Items:
• Working capital components (AR, AP, Inventory) with turnover ratios
• Property, Plant & Equipment with CapEx and depreciation schedules
• Intangible assets and goodwill treatment
• Debt structure with maturity schedules
• Equity components (common stock, retained earnings, other equity)
• Cash and cash equivalents with minimum operating requirements

Cash Flow Statement Projections (10 years)
Key Line Items:
• Operating cash flow reconciliation to net income
• CapEx requirements with growth and maintenance components
• Working capital changes with business cycle considerations
• Debt issuance/repayment schedules
• Dividend payments and share repurchases
• Free cash flow calculation and reconciliation

Reconciliation Checks
Critical Validations:
• Cash flow statement balances to balance sheet cash changes
• Depreciation expense matches balance sheet accumulated depreciation
• Interest expense reconciles with debt balances and rates
• Tax expense aligns with pre-tax income and tax rates
• Working capital changes flow through all three statements consistently

Key Value Drivers
Identify and Quantify:
• Top 3-5 line items that drive the largest valuation swings
• Sensitivity analysis for each key driver
• Scenario impact on overall valuation
• Risk factors that could materially affect projections

Excel Output Requirement
Deliver: DCF_Model_[Company].xlsx with:
• Formula-driven calculations (no hardcoded-only values)
• Linked three statements so changes in assumptions flow through to valuation outputs
• Separate worksheets for: Assumptions, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, DCF Summary, Sensitivity Analysis
• Data validation and error checking formulas
• Professional formatting with clear navigation

3. WACC calculation with component breakdown
4. Bull/base/bear scenario analysis
5. Sensitivity analysis tables
